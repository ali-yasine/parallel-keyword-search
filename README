Parallel Keyword Search

This repository contains an implementation of a GPU parallelized algorithm based on the paper An Efficient Parallel Keyword Search Engine on
Knowledge Graphs by (Yang et al.) .
The algorithm is designed to take input keywords from the user and search over a knowledge graph to find k meaningful subgraphs that connect the keywords together.

Installation
To use this algorithm, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

CUDAC++ 
GCC (>= 10.1.0)

You can install the algorithm by following these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/ali-yasine/parallel-keyword-search.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd parallel-keyword-search
Navigate to lib: cd lib
Compile the code: make

Usage:

./pks

This will initialize the program by reading the graph specified and constructing an informativeness index if one is not found.

After initilization is done the program will keep reading inputs from the user and will write the result to the corresponding txt file.
